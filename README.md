Iksokodo is a background service that converts keystrokes into the Esperanto X-system.

This is a continuation of https://github.com/winggar/XSistemoKonvertilo

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [You use a machine supported by .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md)
- You have .NET 6 installed
- You have downloaded the file "build.zip" from the latest release

OR

- [You use a **Windows** machine supported by .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md)
- You **do not** need to have .NET 6 installed
- You have downloaded the file "standalone.zip" from the latest release

Due to low demand, standalone builds for Mac OSX and Linux are not provided. If you'd like a standalone build for Mac OSX or Linux, [contact me](mailto:winggar1228@gmail.com).

## Usage

1. Download either "build.zip" or "standalone.zip" from the latest release, depending on your prerequisites.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Find the file "Iksokodo.exe" within the unzipped folder and run it.
4. Now, type in Esperanto X-system and watch it get converted!
5. If you need to escape an X character, put an apostrophe before the X. Example: "c'x" => "cx"
6. To pause or resume Iksokodo, click its icon on the system tray or use the hotkey (default is Alt + E).
7. To exit Iksokodo, right-click its icon on the system tray and choose "Exit".
