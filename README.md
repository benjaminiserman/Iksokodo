# Iksokodo
a background service that converts keystrokes into the Esperanto X-system

This is a continuation of https://github.com/winggar/XSistemoKonvertilo

To use, run Iksokodo.exe. Then:

When typing in the Esperanto X-System, keystrokes will be converted to their Esperanto equivalent. For example, typing "cx" will result in "ĉ".

To escape a character, type an apostrophe before the x. For example, typing "c'x" will result in "cx".

To pause or resume Iksokodo, click its icon on the system tray.

To exit Iksokodo, right-click its icon on the system tray and choose "Exit".
